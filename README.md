![WebGL Water running in Unity 6 / URP — a tiled pool with a half-submerged ball, surface ripples and floor caustics](docs/screenshot.png)

An interactive pool of water you can poke, ripple, and drop a ball into, with
real-time caustics on the floor — running entirely on the GPU inside Unity.

## Features

- **GPU heightfield simulation** — 256×256 ping-pong float texture driven by a
  compute shader (drop / wave-propagation / normal / sphere-displacement kernels).
- **In-shader ray tracing** — the water surface analytically reflects and
  refracts the pool, the ball, and a sky cubemap, exactly like the original.
- **Projected caustics** — the water grid is projected onto the floor to compute
  light focusing.
- **Blob & rim shadows** — the ball casts a soft shadow; the pool rim self-shadows.
- **Volume conservation** — the surface stays level no matter how hard you ripple it.
- **Reusable orbit camera** — drag to orbit, scroll to zoom.
- **Designer knobs** — wave speed, damping, sub-steps, ripple strength/radius,
  and reflection strength, all exposed in the inspector.
- **Self-contained** — a one-click editor menu builds the whole scene, including
  a procedural sky cubemap and a fallback tile texture.

## Requirements

- **Unity 6** (developed on `6000.3.9f1`).
- **Universal Render Pipeline** (`17.3.0`).
- A GPU that supports **compute shaders** and **RGBAFloat** random-write
  textures (any modern desktop/console GPU; GLES3.1+/Metal/Vulkan on mobile).

## Quick start

1. Open the project in Unity 6 and let it import (no console errors expected).
2. Menu **Tools ▸ WebGL Water**:
   - **Build Scene (water only — keep my pool)** if you've already built a pool.
   - **Build Scene (with analytic pool)** for the original look out of the box
     (includes a procedurally textured pool that receives the caustics).
3. Press **Play**.

The builder generates the meshes, materials, a procedural sky cubemap and a
fallback tile texture under `Assets/WebGLWater/Generated/`, and wires up the
camera and the `Water Controller`.

## Controls

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Drag on the water | Make ripples |
| Drag the ball | Move it and displace water |
| Drag the background | Orbit the camera |
| Scroll wheel | Zoom |
| **Space** | Pause / resume the simulation |
| **G** | Toggle ball gravity / physics |
| **L** (hold) | Point the light along the camera view |

## Tuning (Water Controller inspector)

| Knob | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Wave Speed** (0.1–2.0) | Propagation stiffness. Higher = faster, livelier waves (stable up to ~2.0). |
| **Damping** (0.90–1.0) | How quickly ripples fade. Lower = choppier; toward 1.0 = glassy. |
| **Steps Per Frame** (1–8) | Simulation sub-steps. More = faster, smoother propagation. |
| **Ripple Strength / Radius** | Size and intensity of a click/drag ripple. |
| **Conserve Volume** | Keeps the surface from drifting up/down as ripples are added. |
| **Reflection Strength** (0–1) | On the water materials. 1 = original Fresnel; 0 = fully see-through. |

> Presets — *calm pond:* waveSpeed ~1.0, damping ~0.99, steps 2.
> *energetic:* waveSpeed 2.0, damping 0.997, steps 3–4, higher ripple strength.

## Using your own pool

The water surface ray-traces an **analytic** pool defined in normalized space:
floor at `y = -1`, walls up to `y = 2/12`, spanning `x,z ∈ [-1, 1]` (1 unit = the
demo's unit). For your own pool's reflections to match, keep it at those
dimensions and assign your tile texture to **Water Controller ▸ Tiles**.

## How it maps to the original

| Original (`evanw/webgl-water`) | This port |
| --- | --- |
| `water.js` | `WaterSim.compute` + `WaterSimulation.cs` |
| `renderer.js` helper functions | `WaterCommon.hlsl` |
| water / cube / sphere shaders | `WaterSurface` / `PoolWall` / `WaterSphere` shaders |
| `updateCaustics` | `Caustics.shader` drawn into a 1024² RT via a CommandBuffer |
| `main.js` (input, camera, physics) | `WaterController.cs` + `OrbitCamera.cs` |

There's a more detailed developer guide in
[`Assets/WebGLWater/README.md`](Assets/WebGLWater/README.md), including the few
in-editor tweaks you may need (face-culling direction, caustic Y-flip, color space).

## Known limitations

It's a **contained, heightfield** water — great for pools, ponds and fountains,
not oceans. It simulates vertical displacement only (no breaking waves/splashes),
covers a single bounded body of water, and its reflections see only the cubemap +
analytic pool + the one ball (not arbitrary scene geometry). The simulation lives
on the GPU, so gameplay interaction (buoyancy, floating objects) needs an
`AsyncGPUReadback` of the height texture. See the developer guide for the full list.
